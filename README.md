Its a simple app to send Html email. It uses **@sendgrid/mail** npm module ( Mail service from sendgrid).

This app currently uses pre made HTML email template as an example, but we can customize it according to our need or to make it look nicer. Its now really easy to send beautiful HTML email.

This app uses: **Nodejs**, **Express** and **@Sendgrid** mail service.
